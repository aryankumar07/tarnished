# The Complete Guide to Regular Expressions (Regex)

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful patterns used to match and manipulate text. Think of them as a search tool on steroids. Let's learn everything about regex in a simple way.

## What is Regex?

Regex is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It's like giving instructions to find specific text in a document.

**Example:** Finding all email addresses in a text file, validating phone numbers, or replacing specific words.

## Basic Syntax

### Literal Characters

The simplest regex is just plain text:

```regex
hello
```

This matches the word "hello" exactly.

### Special Characters (Metacharacters)

These characters have special meanings:

- `.` - Matches any single character except newline
- `^` - Matches start of string
- `$` - Matches end of string
- `*` - Matches 0 or more times
- `+` - Matches 1 or more times
- `?` - Matches 0 or 1 time
- `|` - OR operator
- `\` - Escape character

## Character Classes

Character classes let you match specific sets of characters.

### Predefined Classes

```regex
\d  - Matches any digit (0-9)
\D  - Matches any non-digit
\w  - Matches any word character (letters, digits, underscore)
\W  - Matches any non-word character
\s  - Matches any whitespace (space, tab, newline)
\S  - Matches any non-whitespace
```

**Example:**
```regex
\d\d\d
```
Matches any three digits like "123" or "456"

### Custom Classes

Use square brackets `[]` to define your own character set:

```regex
[abc]      - Matches a, b, or c
[a-z]      - Matches any lowercase letter
[A-Z]      - Matches any uppercase letter
[0-9]      - Matches any digit
[^abc]     - Matches anything EXCEPT a, b, or c
```

**Example:**
```regex
[aeiou]
```
Matches any vowel

## Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify how many times something should match.

```regex
*       - 0 or more times
+       - 1 or more times
?       - 0 or 1 time (optional)
{n}     - Exactly n times
{n,}    - n or more times
{n,m}   - Between n and m times
```

**Examples:**

```regex
a*      - Matches "", "a", "aa", "aaa", etc.
a+      - Matches "a", "aa", "aaa" (but not empty string)
a?      - Matches "" or "a"
a{3}    - Matches "aaa" exactly
a{2,4}  - Matches "aa", "aaa", or "aaaa"
\d{3}   - Matches exactly 3 digits
```

## Anchors

Anchors don't match characters but positions.

```regex
^       - Start of string/line
$       - End of string/line
\b      - Word boundary
\B      - Not a word boundary
```

**Examples:**

```regex
^Hello  - Matches "Hello" only at the start
World$  - Matches "World" only at the end
\bcat\b - Matches "cat" as a whole word, not "category"
```

## Groups and Capturing

### Parentheses ( )

Groups let you treat multiple characters as a unit:

```regex
(abc)+  - Matches "abc", "abcabc", "abcabcabc"
```

Capturing groups also save the matched text for later use:

```regex
(\d{3})-(\d{4})
```
Captures area code and number separately from "555-1234"

### Non-Capturing Groups

Use `(?:...)` when you need grouping but don't need to capture:

```regex
(?:abc)+
```

## Common Patterns

### Email Address

```regex
[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}
```

### Phone Number (US)

```regex
\(?\d{3}\)?[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}
```
Matches: (123) 456-7890, 123-456-7890, 123.456.7890

### URL

```regex
https?://[^\s]+
```

### Username (alphanumeric, 3-16 characters)

```regex
^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,16}$
```

### Strong Password

```regex
^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$
```
Requires: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit, special char

## Lookahead and Lookbehind

### Lookahead

Matches if followed by something (without including it):

```regex
\d+(?= dollars)  - Matches "50" in "50 dollars" but not the word "dollars"
```

### Negative Lookahead

Matches if NOT followed by something:

```regex
\d+(?! dollars)  - Matches numbers not followed by "dollars"
```

### Lookbehind

Matches if preceded by something:

```regex
(?<=\$)\d+  - Matches "50" in "$50" but not the dollar sign
```

## Flags/Modifiers

Flags change how the regex behaves:

- `g` - Global: find all matches, not just the first
- `i` - Case insensitive
- `m` - Multiline: ^ and $ match line breaks
- `s` - Dot matches newline

**Example in JavaScript:**
```javascript
/hello/gi  // Finds all "hello" case-insensitive
```

## Practical Examples

### Validate Email

```javascript
const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
emailRegex.test("user@example.com"); // true
```

### Extract Numbers from Text

```javascript
const text = "I have 3 apples and 5 oranges";
const numbers = text.match(/\d+/g); // ["3", "5"]
```

### Replace All Spaces with Dashes

```javascript
const text = "hello world example";
const result = text.replace(/\s+/g, "-"); // "hello-world-example"
```

### Find All Hashtags

```javascript
const text = "Love #coding and #regex #tutorial";
const hashtags = text.match(/#\w+/g); // ["#coding", "#regex", "#tutorial"]
```

### Validate Date (YYYY-MM-DD)

```javascript
const dateRegex = /^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/;
dateRegex.test("2025-10-24"); // true
```

## Greedy vs Lazy Matching

By default, quantifiers are greedy (match as much as possible):

```regex
<.+>  - In "<div>Hello</div>", matches the entire string
```

Add `?` after quantifier for lazy matching (match as little as possible):

```regex
<.+?>  - Matches "<div>" and "</div>" separately
```

## Escaping Special Characters

To match special characters literally, escape them with `\`:

```regex
\$\d+\.\d{2}  - Matches "$19.99"
\(hello\)     - Matches "(hello)"
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting to escape special characters**
   - Wrong: `.com` (matches any character + "com")
   - Right: `\.com`

2. **Not anchoring when needed**
   - `\d{4}` matches "2025" in "20259999"
   - `^\d{4}$` matches only "2025"

3. **Overusing greedy quantifiers**
   - Use lazy `*?` or `+?` when needed

4. **Making regex too complex**
   - Break complex patterns into smaller parts
   - Comment your regex for clarity

## Testing and Debugging

Use online tools to test your regex:
- regex101.com
- regexr.com
- regextester.com

These tools show matches, explain patterns, and help debug.

## Conclusion

Regular expressions are incredibly powerful for text processing. Start with simple patterns and gradually build complexity. Practice with real examples, and use testing tools to verify your patterns.

Remember: regex can seem cryptic at first, but with practice, you'll be able to write and understand complex patterns easily. Keep this guide handy as a reference!

Happy pattern matching! 🎯
